                        <p> Dr. Hao Wu is an assistant professor at Computer Science Department of Maynooth University. He receiveds his PhD in Computer Science from Maynooth University. He is actively looking for highly motivated students doing research in Software Engineering.
                            His research aims to create automated software and tools for verifying different kinds of models used in software engineering. He has strong interests in formal methods, programming languages design, program synthesis, relational database and software testing. 
                            Many his work is based on using SAT/SMT solvers , those super well-engineered solvers that make it easier to create fully automated tools for program verification and more.
